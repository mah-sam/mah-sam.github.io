            <div><p>Since the beginning of this website, I have been contemplating writing my own column, but it never came to be. One reason, is that I always question myself, whether I really have that much to say about any topic in existence. The answer becomes clearer when I get involved in online discussions, when a heated debate results in interrupted and fragmented pieces of a 1000 words essay. However, when it comes to &quot;blogging&quot;, I lose all the momentum to speak.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that writing for someone in particular is not the same as writing for a potential group of readers. I am only used to the former case, but I am up for changes, and of course, I will not nail it from the first time. Another question that may come to mind is: why now? I will not pretend that I know the answer, however, I will attempt at providing a reason.</p>

<p>The lack of any physical contact with anyone in such medium is perhaps an important quality when expressing opinions or emotions. It&#x27;s neither about narcissism nor introversion, but the way I think about it is that it allows people to easily navigate what they care and do not care about. So if one saw that my ideas, opinions, and words are worthless, he can brush the post off instantly in one click. Whereas in face-to-face communication, you may bring about topics that the listener is not interested in, which will be obvious to you when speaking to a disagreeable person, but with an agreeable one it will be difficult to definitively know.</p>

<p>Having introverted aspects about myself is not a factor in the first reason, but for this one, which is about the immediacy of responses in the real world, perhaps is. In many situations in daily life, you are not offered time to think before you speak. You memorize what to say and when to say it. It works like a social autopilot. Like when someone says &quot;I am sick&quot;, you are supposed to say something sympathetic like &quot;I hope you get well soon&quot;, but when I try to fetch an immediate appropriate response I get lost in my head thinking about the possible responses, how to formulate them, and whether there are factors I did not take care of while formulating, resulting in a silent response, which is often thought of as rudeness. Evidently, I lack the autopilot, which is hugely important as a social skill, which it makes lots of situations awkward. When a response to what is said is silence, and it&#x27;s not supposed to be. This makes the idea of speaking where I can think of every spoken word an attractive proposition.</p>

<p>As to keep my first post short, two reasons to justify my start is enough. However, many other reasons can be articulated, maybe at another time.</p></div>
